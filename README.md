# Handwriting Recognition using K-Means
The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999. Because its postal offices have to look at roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and understanding addresses. And not only the post office:

- ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks
- Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists
- Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts
